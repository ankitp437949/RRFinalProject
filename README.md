# Telecom Churn Prediction Model

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. The model utilizes a dataset with 7043 rows and 20 columns, with 3 numerical variables. The contributors to this project are Shubham Joshi, Ankit Pandey, and Keith Mpala.


# Model used

Logistic Regression, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(LDA), Decision Tree, Bagging, ADA boost and Random Forest.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.11.4 installed.
2. Install Anaconda, which provides a Python distribution and package manager: [Anaconda Installation Guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
3. After installing Anaconda, open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Create a new conda environment for the project (optional): `conda create -n churn-prediction python=3.11.4`.
5. Activate the environment: `conda activate churn-prediction`.
6. Install the required packages: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib sklearn seaborn`.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd churn-prediction`.
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook server: `jupyter notebook`.
4. Open the `churn_prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the ML model, and evaluate its performance.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required for this project. The code in the notebook already handles data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. However, if you want to customize any parameters or settings, you can modify the respective sections in the notebook.
